This directory contains an experimental PEG grammar for ADQL, largely
derived from the published BNF grammar.

Caveats:

* We hope the syntax is portable PEG.  For our reference implementation,
  which is based on arpeggio, we employ some lightweight translation
  into this library's PEG dialect.
* We're using a custom arpeggio feature for case folding.  The grammar
  would be too ugly without it.
* We're using negative lookhead, which is a (common) extension to
  classic PEG.

Trying it out:

This directory contains the testpeg.py script that, when started here,
will run all example queries collected under adql.  It will report
both false positives and false negatives.

As said above, you'll need arpeggio for that; see
https://pypi.org/project/Arpeggio/

For this particular attempt we're using arpeggio, 
http://www.igordejanovic.net/Arpeggio/stable/; we'll have to see how
portable the resulting PEG is; in particular.
