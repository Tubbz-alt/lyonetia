This directory contains an experimental PEG grammar for ADQL, largely
derived from the published BNF grammar.

Caveats:

* Syntax is currently arpeggio's PEG one; I suspect at least the r'x'
  syntax shouldn't be used.
* We're using a custom arpeggio feature for case folding.  The grammar
  would be too ugly without it.
* We're using negative lookhead, which is a (common) extension to
  classic PEG.

For this particular attempt we're using arpeggio, 
http://www.igordejanovic.net/Arpeggio/stable/; we'll have to see how
portable the resulting PEG is; in particular.
